## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **If Expressions**: Complete implementation of `if ... do ... else ... end` expressions with proper type inference and Erlang code generation. Features include:
  - **Basic If/Else**: Support for `if condition do expr1 else expr2 end` syntax
  - **If without Else**: Support for `if condition do expr end` (returns `nil` when condition is false)
  - **Nested If**: Full support for nested if expressions within then/else branches
  - **Type Inference**: Intelligent type inference that returns the concrete type when both branches have the same type, or the non-nil type when one branch is nil
  - **Erlang Generation**: Translates if expressions to Erlang `case` statements with proper true/false pattern matching
  - **Complex Conditions**: Support for any boolean expression as condition including variables, comparisons, and arithmetic operations
- **Directives System**: Implemented a comprehensive compile-time directives system that allows metadata and compilation control. Directives are prefixed with `@` and must be placed immediately before function definitions. The system includes:
  - **`@reflection`**: Prints detailed type information for function parameters, guards, and body expressions during compilation, showing line-by-line type inference results
  - **`@inline`**: Marks a function for inlining optimization (planned)
  - **`@deprecated`**: Marks a function as deprecated (planned)
  - **Directive Processing**: Lexer recognizes `@directive` tokens, parser collects and associates directives with function ASTs, and typechecker processes directives during compilation
  - **Type Reflection**: The `@reflection` directive provides comprehensive debugging information including parameter types, guard types, and body expression types with precise line and column information
- **Variable Scope Checking Integration**: Integrated automatic variable scope checking into the main compilation pipeline. The compiler now automatically validates variable declarations, usage, and scope rules during compilation, providing precise error messages with correct line and column positions.
- **Enhanced Variable Error Reporting**: Improved variable error messages to show exact source code positions (line:column) instead of generic 0:0 positions. Variable scope errors now include precise location information for better debugging experience.
- **Variable Scope Validation**: Comprehensive variable scope checking that detects undefined variables, rebinding attempts, and shadowing violations with detailed error messages and suggestions for fixing common issues.
- **Stack-Based Variable Checker**: Implemented a robust variable scope checker using a stack-based approach without unsafe operations or circular references, following V language idioms and best practices.
- **Type System Helper Functions**: Added missing helper functions `make_type_var()` and `make_type_constructor()` to the type system for creating type variables and type constructors with proper type safety.
- **AST Position Tracking**: Enhanced AST nodes to include proper position tracking for VariableExpr, ensuring accurate error reporting throughout the compilation pipeline.
- **Enhanced Function Multi-Clause Validation**: Improved parser to properly validate multi-clause functions, ensuring they contain at least one valid clause. Functions declared as `def func do ... end` must now include at least one clause with parameters (e.g., `(x) -> x + 1`). Single-clause functions still require parentheses: `def func() do ... end`. Added comprehensive error messages with practical examples and didactic suggestions for both valid syntax patterns.
- **Didactic Error Suggestions**: Enhanced error suggestion system with practical examples for function syntax errors. When encountering invalid function declarations, the compiler now provides clear examples of correct multi-clause and single-clause function syntax, helping users understand the difference between `def func do (x) -> x end` (valid multi-clause) and `def func() do x end` (valid single-clause).
- **Enhanced Error Handling System**: Comprehensive error categorization with support for Syntax, Type, Pattern, Record, Binary, Guard, and Dependency errors. Added contextual suggestions with intelligent hints for fixing common errors, visual error markers with source code highlighting, and improved error message formatting with categories and context.
- **Advanced Type System**: Complete Hindley-Milner type inference implementation with type variables, robust type substitution operations, and advanced unification algorithm supporting all type constructs. Added comprehensive built-in types (integer, float, string, boolean, atom, nil, any, unknown) with proper type checking and inference.
- **Error Formatting Tests**: Dedicated test suite for the enhanced error handling system, ensuring all error categories and suggestions work correctly.
- **External Function Calls**: Implemented new syntax for external module function calls using `:module.function(args...)` format. This provides clear distinction between record field access (`variable.field`) and external function calls (`:module.function`). The syntax generates proper Erlang `module:function(args...)` calls and supports multiple arguments. Examples: `:io.format("Hello")`, `:lists.map(fn, [1,2,3])`, `:erlang.process_info(pid)`.
- **Parser Base Structure**: Complete recursive descent parser implementation with token management, error recovery, and precedence table
- **Error Recovery System**: Robust error handling that continues parsing after encountering invalid tokens, synchronizing to block boundaries (def, defp, worker, supervisor, etc.)
- **Expression Parsing**: Comprehensive parsing of literals, variables, assignments, and function calls including external module calls (`:module.function`)
- **Data Structures Parsing**: Complete parsing of tuples, lists, cons expressions, and maps with nested structure support
- **Operator Precedence**: Full implementation of operator precedence and associativity for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- **Recovery Strategy**: Parser continues processing multiple expressions even when errors occur, reporting all errors found in the code
- **Guards (when expressions)**: Complete implementation of Erlang-style guards with support for type tests, logical operators (and, or, not, andalso, orelse), and operator conversion (!= to /=, <= to =<)
- **Send operator (!)**: Message passing operator for inter-process communication with proper precedence and AST structure
- **Receive expressions**: Blocking pattern matching for process messages with timeout support and guard expressions
- **Records**: Structured data types with named fields, including creation, field access, updates, and pattern matching
- **Maps**: Key-value data structures with atom keys (colon syntax) and general keys (arrow syntax), including creation, access, and pattern matching
- **Fun expressions**: Anonymous functions with support for single and multi-clause definitions, pattern matching, and closures
- **Binary/Bitstring support**: Complete implementation for binary creation, pattern matching, and type specifications
- **List Comprehensions (for loops)**: Enhanced for loops with guards, pattern matching, and complex data structure iteration
- **Match/Rescue expressions**: Error handling construct with individual and sequential pattern matching steps
- **OTP Components**: Worker and supervisor definitions with validation and proper callback requirements
- **Module System**: Dependency management with global and per-file declarations, type validation via BEAM files
- **Enhanced Pattern Matching**: Support for complex patterns including maps, records, tuples, and nested structures
- **Type System Improvements**: Comprehensive type checking for all new constructs with proper error reporting
- **Logical operators `andalso`/`&&` and `orelse`/`||` now generate `andalso` and `orelse` in Erlang output, matching modern BEAM semantics.
- **Lexer recognizes both symbolic and word forms for these operators.
- **Didactic Examples**: Added a comprehensive set of didactic `.lx` example files in `lxc/examples/`, covering basic to advanced features (syntax, pattern matching, functions, control flow, data structures, OTP, concurrency, specifications, testing, and a full application). All examples follow the official Lx syntax and ensure every expression is inside a function, serving as reference and test material for users and contributors.
- **Lexer Token Refactoring**: Refactored `KeywordToken`, `OperatorToken`, and `PunctuationToken` from enums to structs with a `value` field containing the corresponding enum (`KeywordValue`, `OperatorValue`, `PunctuationValue`). Added helper functions `keyword()`, `operator()`, and `punctuation()` for simplified token creation. This improves type safety and provides a more consistent token structure throughout the lexer and parser.
- **Função utilitária de teste**: Adicionada `assert_lx_generates_erlang(lx_code, expected_erlang)` para facilitar testes automatizados comparando código LX e o Erlang gerado. Permite escrever testes limpos e diretos usando apenas strings, sem manipulação manual de tokens.
- **Type Aliases**: Support for type alias declarations using `type name :: type_expression`. Example: `type number :: float | integer`.
- **Type Alias Modifiers**: Support for `opaque` and `nominal` type aliases using `type opaque name :: type_expression` and `type nominal name :: type_expression`. These generate `-opaque` and `-nominal` declarations in Erlang respectively, providing better type encapsulation and distinct type semantics.
- **Type Annotations in Assignments**: Support for variable assignments with type annotations, e.g., `x :: int = 1`.
- **Type Annotations in Function Parameters**: Support for annotating function parameters with types or type aliases, e.g., `def add(a :: int, b :: number) do ... end`.
- **Automatic Spec Generation**: The compiler now automatically generates Erlang `-spec` declarations for all functions based on type annotations and intelligent type inference. Specs are positioned immediately above each function definition and use parameter context to infer accurate return types.
- **Enhanced Type Inference**: Improved type inference system that can infer return types from function bodies, including support for tuples, lists, arithmetic operations, and variable references using parameter context.

### Fixed
- **Fixed Variable Position Tracking**: Corrected AST position tracking for VariableExpr nodes to ensure accurate error reporting. Variable scope errors now show correct line and column positions instead of generic 0:0 positions, improving debugging experience.
- **Fixed Type System Compilation**: Resolved compilation errors in the type system by adding missing helper functions `make_type_var()` and `make_type_constructor()` and correcting type references from `ast.IntLiteral` to `ast.IntegerLiteral`.
- **Fixed Variable Checker Integration**: Corrected the integration of variable scope checking into the main compilation pipeline, ensuring proper error result handling and module statement processing.
- **Fixed lexer negative number handling**: Removed the `maybe_negative` state from the lexer to follow modern compiler design principles. The lexer now always separates the minus operator (`-`) from numbers, leaving the interpretation of negative numbers to the parser phase. This ensures correct tokenization for expressions like `n-1` (which now produces `IdentToken("n")`, `OperatorToken.minus`, `IntToken(1)`) and eliminates ambiguity in complex expressions.
- **Fixed lexer whitespace transitions**: Corrected the whitespace state transitions to properly return to the initial state after consuming whitespace characters. This prevents the lexer from getting stuck in the whitespace state and ensures proper tokenization of code after spaces and newlines.
- **Fixed private function exports**: Corrected Erlang code generation to not export functions defined with `defp` (private functions). Private functions are now properly marked in the AST and excluded from the export list in generated Erlang modules, ensuring they remain internal to the module as intended.
- **Fixed multi-head function parsing**: Corrected parser to properly detect and parse multi-head functions with multiple clauses. The parser now correctly distinguishes between single-head (`def name(params) do ... end`) and multi-head (`def name do ... end`) functions, and properly handles clause boundaries by detecting the `( ... ) ->` pattern without consuming tokens from the next clause.
- Fixed parser error handling to register errors but continue parsing, ensuring all syntax errors are reported
- Fixed parser synchronization to skip tokens until finding block boundaries after encountering errors
- Fixed operator precedence parsing to correctly handle complex expressions with multiple operators
- Fixed data structure parsing to support nested tuples, lists, and maps with proper error recovery
- Fixed `utils.unescape_string` to use `result += s[i..i+1]` for correct string handling, ensuring all foundation tests pass and proper V idioms are followed.
- Fixed string literal parsing in lexer to correctly handle escaped quotes (`\"`) and prevent premature string termination.
- Fixed lexer transitions for strings to properly validate invalid characters (like `@`) within string literals.
- Fixed record update compilation to use correct record type names instead of generic #record syntax
- Fixed map pattern matching to handle mixed key types and provide clear error messages for missing fields
- Fixed guard compilation to properly convert Lx operators to Erlang equivalents
- Fixed send operator precedence and associativity for correct message passing semantics
- Fixed receive expression compilation to generate proper Erlang receive blocks with timeout handling
- Fixed fun expression compilation to support both simple and multi-clause anonymous functions
- Fixed binary pattern matching to handle complex specifications and size expressions
- Fixed OTP validator to properly check required callbacks and component structure
- Fixed module generation to handle dependencies and generate correct Erlang module structure
- Fixed typechecker types tests: corrected module imports, updated usage to match the current typechecker API, and fixed string assertion for function type representation in list context (now expects 'list((T1) -> T2)'). All type system tests now pass.
- Fixed: Assignment parsing in function bodies now correctly accepts `name = "Alice"` and similar statements, matching LX syntax reference. (2024-06-09)
- **Assignment with Type Annotation Parsing**: Fixed parsing so that assignments with type annotations (e.g., `x :: int = 1`) are accepted inside function bodies, matching the LX syntax reference and type system.

### Changed
- **Reflection output now preserves type aliases**: The @reflection directive now prints the original type alias (e.g., `int`) for function parameters and return types in the signature, and for parameter variables in the function body. This ensures that user-defined type aliases are shown instead of the resolved base type (e.g., `int` instead of `integer`), improving clarity and fidelity to the source code.
- **Improved guard formatting in reflection**: The @reflection directive now displays guard expressions in a clean, readable format instead of showing the internal AST representation. Guards are shown as simple expressions (e.g., `x > 0`) rather than verbose AST nodes (e.g., `Binary(Var(x) > Literal(LInt(0)))`), making the reflection output much more user-friendly.
